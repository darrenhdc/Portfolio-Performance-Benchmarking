# Portfolio-Performance-Benchmarking
### author: darren
This Project is from the coursera course: Investment Strategies and Portfolio Analysis, from Rice University

### PROMPT
Compute the following return and risk measures for the DSFCX and DSFVX funds along with the S&P 500 index. Use S&P 500 index as the benchmark for all your analysis. (Hint: Note that you will not be computing excess return and risk measures for the S&P 500 index)

Note: Take the average returns for S&P to calculate the excess return for both the funds.

Here provides the performance data of three underlying assets:
- DFSCX	
- DFSVX 
- S&P 500

This project will compute the following indicators
1. Arithmetic average monthly return
2. Monthly standard deviation
3. Geometric average monthly return
4. Annualized arithmetic average return
5. Annualized volatility
6. Arithmetic mean excess monthly return
7. Annualized arithmetic mean excess return
8. Geometric mean excess monthly return
9. Annualized geometric mean excess return
10. Target semideviation
11. Tracking error
